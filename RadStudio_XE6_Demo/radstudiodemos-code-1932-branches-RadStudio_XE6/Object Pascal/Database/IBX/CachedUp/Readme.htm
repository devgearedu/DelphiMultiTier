			<strong>This example demonstrates how cached updates can be used with live data and in conjunction with the UpdateSQL component for non-live data.<br /><br />
			When working with live data, updates are performed by the BDE, otherwise the updates are performed by the UpdateSQL component.<br /><br />
			This example also uses a calculated field which shows the current update status of each record (only when cached updates are enabled).<br /><br />
			Errors which occur during the update process are displayed in a simple form which shows the new and old values together. There are buttons which allow the user to determine what type of action take.  To see the update error dialog in action, try changing the ProjID field of one record to be the same as the ProjID of another record. This will cause a key violation when the apply updates button is clicked. When the error dialog comes up, if you click the abort button, no updates will be performed and the dataset will be restored to the state it was in before the updates were applied.  If you click the skip button, any other changes you made will be applied, but not the one with the invalid ProjID. The last option would be to change the ProjID to something valid (such as the old value) and then click the retry button.

			This example requires that Interbase XE be installed. Make sure the server is running before you run the example.
